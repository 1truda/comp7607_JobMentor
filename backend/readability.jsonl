Then, it checks for divisibility by 2 and 3. Finally, it checks for divisibility by numbers of the form `6k \u00b1 1` up to the square root of `n`. If the number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.", "updates": [{"suggestion": "One suggestion to improve the readability of this code could be to add more comments explaining the logic and purpose of each section of the code.
