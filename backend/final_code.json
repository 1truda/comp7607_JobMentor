{"original_description": "Write a Python function to check if a number is prime.", "code": "The error message \"stdin:1:14: E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax\" seems to indicate that there is a problem with the code that was not provided in the question. However, based on the code snippet with added comments that is provided, one suggestion to improve readability could be to add more descriptive variable names. For example, instead of `i`, we could use `current_check` to make it more clear what the variable represents.\n\nHere is the fixed code with the suggested improvement:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    # Check for basic cases where n is less than or equal to 1 or 2 and 3\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    # Check if n is divisible by 2 or 3\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    # Start checking from 5 and increment by 6 each time\n    current_check = 5\n    while current_check * current_check <= n:\n        # Check if n is divisible by current_check or current_check + 2\n        if n % current_check == 0 or n % (current_check + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        current_check += 6\n    # If no divisors are found, n is prime\n    return True\n```\n\nBy using more descriptive variable names, it makes the code easier to understand and follow."}
